# Coursach

Simple full-stack pretty-shitty site about musical instruments

# How to get running

You need to have `docker` installed. Then run this: `docker-compose up --build`.

# Note

Project is very poor, just because i wanted to have a light grasp of working with 
`express`/`handlebars`/`docker`/`mysql`. So it could be easily polished to be pretty, 
but for now it is just a dead template of my work(and a little help to friend of mine).
